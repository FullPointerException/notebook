** Arnold Blueprint
*** Methods
**** 1-10
After a warmup setor two, find a weight you can only do one rep. After you perform that 1 rep, take just enough weight off to be able to perform 2 reps. From here, do the same for 3 reps and 4 reps, going all the way up to 10 reps.
**** Stripping
After a warmup, do 5 reps then immediately take weight off and go for another 5-8 reps. Repeat this process, reducing the weight, until you're just at the bar. Rep the bar for 20 reps.
**** Running The Rack
Go down in dumbbell weight and increasing reps.
**** 1/4 Rep
Do an additional 1/4 movement at the end of the rep.
**** 28
7 regular reps, 7 extra slow reps, 7 1/2 reps at the top, and 7 1/2 reps at the bottom
**** 5-Count
5 seconds up and 5 seconds down
**** Max Effort
Work up to the max weight using the following rep counts: 20, 15, 10, 8, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1(max)
